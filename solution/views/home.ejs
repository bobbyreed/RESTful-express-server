    <h2>Welcome to the Product Management System</h2>
    <p>This was built in an Advanced Web Programming Class by a very chaotic <s>student</s> professor.</p><br>

    <div class="actions">

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete CRUD operations for products - <em>create, read, update, and delete</em></li>
        <li>File-based data persistence - Products are stashed in /data/products.json</li>
        <li>API endpoints for integration</li>
        <li>Responsive frontend interface</li>
        <li>Input validation and error handling</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Broken Stuff (that I may one day fix)</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Edit products doesn't work using the gui form, however, it does work using API PUT method</li>
        <li><em>Not broken, but </em>logic is needed to handle strings, floats, and ints for form inputs. Currently, there is
            validation on the form (frontend), but doesn't have a backend check. Ideally, we would have both.</li>
        <li><em>Not broken, but </em>The product list doesn't perform any sort when pulled. Should implement multiple sorts and a dropdown to select which one.</li>
    </ul>
